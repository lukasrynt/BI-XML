         <h1>Happenings in the LDP world</h1>
         <article>Lampadas updateDavid Lawyer talked to David Merrill regarding Lampadas. David Merrill
            is still working on Lampadas. Lampadas now, is not really "lampadas" but "plone".
            David's lampadas work consists of additions to plone so that when it's done, lampadas
            will be part of plone. When it gets done, we will just need to install plone and we
            will then have lampadas. He estimated it will be in Beta in about 6 months from now.</article>
         <article>Linuxgazette forkThomas Adam on behalf of the editor team of LinuxGazette.net informed
            us that there was a fork of the popular LinuxGazette magazine and requested that TLDP
            should mirror http://linuxgazette.net. Rick Moen explained the reasons for the fork.</article>
         <article>Temporary Removal of documents for reviewAfter discussing the quality of Alavoor Vasudevan's
            HOWTOs, it has been decided that they should be removed from TLDP collection. Greg
            Ferguson announced the same on the staff mailing list with the mail exchange between
            TLDP review coordinator Tabatha and Al Dev. David Lawyer posted a few reasons why
            this was necessary.</article>
         <article>RPM package for LDP author toolsRodolfo J. Paiz said on docbook@en.tldp.org that Tom
            "Spot" Callaway from RedHat would help him put together an ldp-author-tools RPM package.
            This would make it easier for people running Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake, or other RPM-based
            distros to set up a comfortable working environment to create documentation for LDP.
            Rodolfo is interested in feedback regarding the what the contents of the package should
            be and can be reached via discuss@en.tldp.org.</article>
         <article>Updated LDP-Author-GuideEmma Jane Hogbin posted an update to the LDP Author Guide.
            The single HTML file version is available for a week at her site, but the XML sources
            have been changed again already. The Author Guide is no longer a How to write DocBook
            documents for the LDP. Emma spent considerable time working on this and also posted
            a TODO list for the guide in her mail.</article>
         <article>TWiki advocacy for TLDPRandy Kramer posted a long mail about Using A Wiki (TWiki)
            at LDP. Randy wanted to respond to Rodolfo's questions. His answers are also available
